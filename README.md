## Task 1: Gather Feedback
- The app has a list of questions saved in the react context.  Take these questions and create the user interface needed to collect answers.
- Update the app to save the results for multiple users.  We will use these answers in the next step.  The saved results for do not need to persist through a page refresh but the app should allow full navigation without data loss.
- Follow the designs.

## Task 2: Display Feedback
- Display the feedback you collected for each individual user.
- Follow the designs.

## Task 3: Deploy the App
- Deploy and provide the URL.

## Bonus Tasks (optional)
Feel free to use any the following task if you are just getting warmed up:

- [ ] Add a “no feedback” state to the review page per designs
- [ ] Add A11y testing and update components to comply
- [ ] Create a dark theme for the project
- [ ] Write some documentation
- [ ] Help the app be more responsive
- [ ] Implement flagging questions
- [ ] Implement rating questions
- [ ] Style the 404 page per designs
- [ ] Update the app’s data to support multiple feedback collections for a single person
- [ ] Write some tests (jest, cypress, react testing library, etc)

Or just do something else you think would would be cool and tell us about it.
